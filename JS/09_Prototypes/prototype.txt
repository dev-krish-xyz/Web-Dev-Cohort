1. Array.prototype : parent class which contains all the inbuilt functions
let arr = [1,3,4,];
2. arr.__proto__ : inherits all the properties of prototype of parent Array class
-> Array.prototype.extra = function (){
    console.log('chai');
}

this will create a extra function inside the prototype and we can access through the newly defined array
